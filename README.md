### Project 1:

My theme is an online Lemonade stand (working title) that can take orders and sell different flavors. 

In its database would be an inventory of different priced beverages, toppings, customer IDs, orders. 

Each order will decrease the amount of stock, so it should restock from a supplier at a cost.

Users may choose additional toppings for added charge.

Users may purchase an order as a guest or create an account for additional rewards or discounts

At the end of the day, it should provide a list of the expenses made and save it.

Technologies to be included:
⁃	GitHub Organization repo (SakuraMatrix)
⁃	Java 8+
⁃	Maven
⁃	Junit 4+
⁃	SLF4J: Log4J2, or Logback, etc.
⁃	Reactor Netty (io.projectreactor.netty:reactor-netty:1.0.9)
⁃	Apache Cassandra w/ Datastax driver
⁃	Spring Framework
⁃	Spring Core/Beans/Context
⁃	Amazon Web Services (kinda optional)
